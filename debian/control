Description: Stu's Powerful I/O Tester
 Spit is a comprehensive tool designed for testing block devices and
 file systems. It offers a robust suite of testing capabilities including
 latency tests, speed tests, and multi-threaded conflict resolution tests.
 .
 It's particularly useful for validating system performance and reliability,
 with features specifically designed to test Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA)
 actions, caches, read-ahead and action ordering. This functionality helps in
 identifying and resolving issues that might arise in custom block devices and
 file systems.
 .
 Spit also supports decoupling of writes from verification, allowing
 system reboots in between, which is crucial for system resilience
 testing.
 .
 This makes spit an indispensable tool for system administrators, developers,
 and performance engineers looking to evaluate and improve system performance
 and stability.
